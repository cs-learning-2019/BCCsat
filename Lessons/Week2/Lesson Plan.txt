1) Take up the homework

2) Lets answer the following puzzles
- There are two ducks in front of a duck, two ducks behind a duck and a duck in the middle. How many ducks are there?

- Five people were eating apples, A finished before B, but behind C. D finished before E, but behind B. What was the finishing order?

- Jack is looking at Anne. Anne is looking at George. Jack is married, George is not, and we donâ€™t know if Anne is married. Is a married person looking at an unmarried person?

- A man has 53 socks in his drawer: 21 identical blue, 15 identical black and 17 identical red. The lights are out and he is completely in the dark. 
  How many socks must he take out to make 100 percent certain he has at least one pair of black socks?

- You have 4 bags of apples. The apples in the first three bags each weigh 1kg. The apples in the fourth bag weigh 1.1kg. You lose track of the order of the bags.
  You are lucky and have a scale that you can use only once. This means you can only go to the scale once to make only one measurement. How can you find out which bag
  Has the apples which weigh 1.1kg each?

3) Lets take a look at algebraic modeling, in more detail
- Variables, the four main operators and inequalities
- We do this to be concise and to save time (ie/ instead of drawing shapes you can label them with letters)

- 4 rectangles is heavier than one circle, but 3 is lighter than 2 circles. 2 rectangles is the same weight as one triangle
  Is 2 triangles heavier, lighter or equal to one circle?
  Is a triangle + a rectangle heavier, lighter or equal to 2 circles?
  Is a triangle + 6 rectangles heavier, lighter or equal to 2 circles?
