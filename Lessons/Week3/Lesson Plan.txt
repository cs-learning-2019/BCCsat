1) Lets take a look at algebraic modeling, in more detail
- Variables, the four main operators and inequalities
- We do this to be concise and to save time (ie/ instead of drawing shapes you can label them with letters)

- 4 rectangles is heavier than one circle, but 3 is lighter than 2 circles. 2 rectangles is the same weight as one triangle
  Is 2 triangles heavier, lighter or equal to one circle?
  Is a triangle + a rectangle heavier, lighter or equal to 2 circles?
  Is a triangle + 6 rectangles heavier, lighter or equal to 2 circles?

2) Lets look at some past BCC contest questions!
